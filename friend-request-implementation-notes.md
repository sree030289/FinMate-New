# Implementation Notes - Friend Request Feature

## Overview
This document provides instructions for integrating the friend request feature with QR code scanning into the FinMate app.

## Components Created
1. **FriendRequestsScreen** - For managing incoming and outgoing friend requests
2. **QRCodeScannerScreen** - For scanning QR codes to add friends

## Required Dependencies
Please install these dependencies to support the new features:
```bash
npm install react-native-qrcode-svg expo-camera expo-barcode-scanner
```

## Navigation Updates
Add these screens to the SplitStackNavigator in `src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`:
```jsx
<SplitStack.Screen name="FriendRequests" component={FriendRequestsScreen} options={{ title: 'Friend Requests' }} />
<SplitStack.Screen name="QRCodeScanner" component={QRCodeScannerScreen} options={{ title: 'Scan QR Code', headerShown: false }} />
```

## Toast Component Updates
The FriendRequestsScreen and QRCodeScannerScreen use the `status` property for toasts, which may need to be adapted to match the app's toast implementation. Replace instances of:
```jsx
toast.show({
  title: "Success",
  description: "Friend request sent",
  status: "success"
});
```

With the appropriate toast format for the project, such as:
```jsx
toast.show({
  title: "Success", 
  description: "Friend request sent",
  variant: "solid"
});
```

## FlatList Component
Our implementation uses FlatList from react-native, but the project may be using native-base's version. Please adjust the FlatList import and usage to match the project's convention.

## Feature Testing Checklist
- [ ] Send friend requests via email
- [ ] Accept/decline incoming requests
- [ ] Generate QR code for friend adding
- [ ] Scan QR code to add friends
- [ ] Verify real-time update of friend request status

## Known Issues
1. Navigation type safety needs proper implementation with the app's navigation structure
2. QR code scanning permissions may need additional handling on different platforms
