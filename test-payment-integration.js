/**
 * HOW TO USE THIS TEST:
 * 
 * 1. In a real app, you'd integrate this with your testing framework
 * 2. For manual testing, you can adapt this code into a test component in the app
 * 3. Check the console for step-by-step progress
 * 
 * The payment flow implementation is now complete with:
 * - Payment initiation (UPI, bank transfer, cash)
 * - Payment verification (manual entry, screenshot upload)
 * - Database updates for payments and expenses
 * - Navigation between relevant screens
